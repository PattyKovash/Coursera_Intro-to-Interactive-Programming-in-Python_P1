Mini-project description - “Guess the number” game

One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. In this project, you will build a simple interactive program in Python where the computer will take the role of the first player while you play as the second player.

When discussing ranges in this mini-project, we will follow the standard Python convention of including the low end of the range and excluding the high end of the range. Mathematically, we will express ranges via the notation [𝚕𝚘𝚠, 𝚑𝚒𝚐𝚑). The square bracket of the left of the range indicates that the corresponding bound should be included. The left parenthesis on the right of the range indicates that corresponding bound should be excluded. For example, the range [𝟶, 𝟹) consists of numbers starting at 0 up to, but not including 3. In other words 0, 1, and 2.

You will interact with your program using an input field and several buttons. For this project, we will ignore the canvas and print the computer's responses in the console. Building an initial version of your project that prints information in the console is a development strategy that you should use in later projects as well. Focusing on getting the logic of the program correct before trying to make it display the information in some “nice” way on the canvas usually saves lots of time since debugging logic errors in graphical output can be tricky.

Mini-project development process:


1. Add code to the program template that creates a frame with an input field whose handler has the name 𝚒𝚗𝚙𝚞𝚝_𝚐𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚜. You will use this input field to enter guesses.
Add code to the event handler 𝚒𝚗𝚙𝚞𝚝_𝚐𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚜(𝚐𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚜) that takes the input string 𝚐𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚜, converts it to an integer, and prints out a message of the form "𝙶𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚜 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝟹𝟽" (or whatever the guess actually was). Hint: We have shown you how to convert strings to numbers in the lectures.

2. Add code to the function 𝚗𝚎𝚠_𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎 that initializes a global variable 𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚛𝚎𝚝_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 to be a random number in the range [𝟶, 𝟷𝟶𝟶). (Note that this range should not include 100 as a possible secret number.) Remember to include a 𝚐𝚕𝚘𝚋𝚊𝚕 statement. Hint: Look at the functions in the 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖 module to figure out how to easily select such a random number. Observe that the call to 𝚗𝚎𝚠_𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎() at the bottom of the template ensures that 𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚛𝚎𝚝_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 is always initialized when the program starts running.

3. Add code to 𝚒𝚗𝚙𝚞𝚝_𝚐𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚜 that compares the entered number to 𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚛𝚎𝚝_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 and prints out an appropriate message such as "𝙷𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚎𝚛", "𝙻𝚘𝚠𝚎𝚛", or "𝙲𝚘𝚛𝚛𝚎𝚌𝚝".
Test your code by playing multiple games of “Guess the number” with a fixed range. At this point, you will need to re-run your program between each game (using the CodeSkulptor “Run” button). You are also welcome to use this testing template http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-gtn_testing_template.py. The bottom of the template contains a sequence of calls to 𝚒𝚗𝚙𝚞𝚝_𝚐𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚜() for three games of "Guess the number". Uncomment each sequence of calls and check whether the output in the console matches that provided in the comments below. Note that your output doesn't have to be identical, just of a similar form.
From this minimal working version of “Guess the number”, the rest of this project consists of adding extra functionality to your project.

There are two improvements that you will need to make to get full credit:

1. Using function(s) in the 𝚜𝚒𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎𝚐𝚞𝚒 module, add buttons to restart the game so that you don't need to repeatedly click “Run” in CodeSkulptor to play multiple games. You should add two buttons with the labels "𝚁𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎 𝚒𝚜 [𝟶,𝟷𝟶𝟶)" and "𝚁𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎 𝚒𝚜 [𝟶,𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟶)" that allow the player to choose different ranges for the secret number. Using either of these buttons should restart the game and print out an appropriate message. They should work at any time during the game. In our implementation, the event handler for each button sets the desired range for the secret number (as a global variable) and then call 𝚗𝚎𝚠_𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎 to reset the secret number in the desired range. As you play “Guess the number”, you might notice that a good strategy is to maintain an interval that consists of the highest guess that is “Lower” than the secret number and the lowest guess that is “Higher” than the secret number. A good choice for the next guess is the number that is the average of these two numbers. The answer for this new guess then allows you to figure a new interval that contains the secret number and that is half as large. For example, if the secret number is in the range [𝟶, 𝟷𝟶𝟶), it is a good idea to guess 𝟻𝟶. If the answer is "Higher", the secret number must be in the range [𝟻𝟷, 𝟷𝟶𝟶). It is then a good idea to guess 𝟽𝟻 and so on. This technique of successively narrowing the range corresponds to a well-known computer algorithm known as binary search.

2. Your final addition to “Guess the number” will be to restrict the player to a limited number of guesses. After each guess, your program should include in its output the number of remaining guesses. Once the player has used up those guesses, they lose, the game prints out an appropriate message, and a new game immediately starts. Since the strategy above for playing “Guess the number” approximately halves the range of possible secret numbers after each guess, any secret number in the range [𝚕𝚘𝚠, 𝚑𝚒𝚐𝚑) can always be found in at most 𝚗 guesses where 𝚗 is the smallest integer such that 𝟸 ** 𝚗 >= 𝚑𝚒𝚐𝚑 - 𝚕𝚘𝚠 + 𝟷. For the range [𝟶, 𝟷𝟶𝟶), 𝚗 is seven. For the range [𝟶, 𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟶), 𝚗 is ten. In our implementation, the function 𝚗𝚎𝚠_𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎() set the number of allowed guess to seven when the range is [𝟶, 𝟷𝟶𝟶) or to ten when the range is [𝟶, 𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟶). For more of a challenge, you may compute 𝚗 from 𝚕𝚘𝚠 and 𝚑𝚒𝚐𝚑 using the functions 𝚖𝚊𝚝𝚑.𝚕𝚘𝚐 and 𝚖𝚊𝚝𝚑.𝚌𝚎𝚒𝚕 in the 𝚖𝚊𝚝𝚑 module.


When your program starts, the game should immediately begin in the range [𝟶, 𝟷𝟶𝟶). When the game ends (because the player either wins or runs out of guesses), a new game with the same range as the last one should immediately begin by calling 𝚗𝚎𝚠_𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎(). Whenever the player clicks one of the range buttons, the current game should stop and a new game with the selected range should begin.
